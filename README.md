# Image Caption Generator

This project is an implementation of an image caption generator using deep learning techniques. The model takes an input image and generates a descriptive caption that describes the content of the image. The project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for language modeling.
## Problem Overview


We see a lot of pictures every day from many sources, including the internet, news stories, schematics in documents, and ads.  Images from these sources can be interpreted 
in various ways by viewers. The majority of photos lack captions, but a human being 
can nevertheless interpret them in significant part without them. To provide automatic 
image captions for people, a machine must be able to understand some kind of captions. 

Blindness poses significant challenges for individuals, but technology can provide assistance in various aspects of daily life.The project's vision is to bring about societal change and promote equal opportunities for people with visual impairments. By combining image and text processing techniques, I have successfully developed a useful deep learning application as part of this project.
## Requirement Analysis

Hardware Requirements
 - Processor: Any Processor above 500 MHz 
 - RAM: 512Mb or above
 - Input device: Standard Keyboard and Mouse 
 - Output device: VGA and High-resolution Monitor

Software Requirements 
 - A Code editor like VS Code
 - Windows 10 or any other Operating System. 
 - A web browser. 
 - Google Colaboratory Notebook
 - Front End: HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, Flask

 Domain & UI Requirements

 - Web Development To make the website live, we will need hosting services and a domain. The website will be created using the HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Flask framework.

- Deep Learning-We will be using TensorFlow algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network, to extract features from the images and then transfer it to the Recurrent Neural Network. The module will be trained using the training dataset which will be acquired from Kaggle.


## Flickr8k dataset

Flickr8k dataset viii is a public benchmark dataset for image to sentence description. This dataset consists of 8000 images with five captions for each image. These images are extracted from diverse groups in Flickr website. Each caption provides a clear description of entities and events present in the image. The dataset depicts a variety of events and scenarios and doesnâ€™t include images containing well-known people and places which makes the dataset more generic. The dataset has 6000 images in training dataset, 1000 images in development dataset and 1000 images in test dataset.
