## Image Caption Generator
This project is an implementation of an image caption generator using deep learning techniques. The model takes an input image and generates a descriptive caption that describes the content of the image. The project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for language modeling.
