# Image Caption Generator

This project is an implementation of an image caption generator using deep learning techniques. The model takes an input image and generates a descriptive caption that describes the content of the image. The project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for language modeling.
## Problem Overview


We see a lot of pictures every day from many sources, including the internet, news stories, schematics in documents, and ads.  Images from these sources can be interpreted 
in various ways by viewers. The majority of photos lack captions, but a human being 
can nevertheless interpret them in significant part without them. To provide automatic 
image captions for people, a machine must be able to understand some kind of captions. 

Blindness poses significant challenges for individuals, but technology can provide assistance in various aspects of daily life.The project's vision is to bring about societal change and promote equal opportunities for people with visual impairments. By combining image and text processing techniques, I have successfully developed a useful deep learning application as part of this project.
